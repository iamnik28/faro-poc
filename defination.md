## 📌 Key Performance Metrics

### 1️⃣ **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) – Page Load Speed**
Measures how long it takes for the largest visible content (image, video, or text) to load. Indicates how quickly users can access the main content.

🔹 **Benchmark:**
- ✅ **Good:** ≤ 2.5s
- ⚠️ **Needs Improvement:** 2.5s - 4s
- ❌ **Poor:** > 4s

---

### 2️⃣ **First Input Delay (FID) – Responsiveness**
Measures the delay between a user's first interaction (click, tap, keypress) and the browser’s response.

🔹 **Benchmark:**
- ✅ **Good:** ≤ 100ms
- ⚠️ **Needs Improvement:** 100ms - 300ms
- ❌ **Poor:** > 300ms

---

### 3️⃣ **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) – Visual Stability**
Tracks unexpected page layout shifts, preventing misclicks and a poor user experience.

🔹 **Benchmark:**
- ✅ **Good:** ≤ 0.1
- ⚠️ **Needs Improvement:** 0.1 - 0.25
- ❌ **Poor:** > 0.25

---

### 4️⃣ **Time to First Byte (TTFB) – Server Response Time**
Measures how long it takes for the browser to receive the first byte of data from the server.

🔹 **Benchmark:**
- ✅ **Good:** ≤ 200ms
- ⚠️ **Okay:** 200ms - 600ms
- ❌ **Slow:** > 600ms

---

### 5️⃣ **Interaction to Next Paint (INP) – Overall Responsiveness**
Captures all interaction delays, not just the first input (an improvement over FID).

🔹 **Benchmark:**
- ✅ **Good:** ≤ 200ms
- ⚠️ **Needs Improvement:** 200ms - 500ms
- ❌ **Poor:** > 500ms

---

### 6️⃣ **First Contentful Paint (FCP) – Initial Page Visibility**
Measures when the first visible content (text or image) appears.

🔹 **Benchmark:**
- ✅ **Good:** ≤ 1.8s
- ⚠️ **Needs Improvement:** 1.8s - 3s
- ❌ **Poor:** > 3s

## 📊 Percentile Metrics (p75) – Real-World Performance Monitoring

### 🔹 **What is p75?**
- Represents the 75th percentile of user experiences.
- **75% of users experience performance at or better than this value**, while 25% experience worse.

### 🔹 **Why is p75 Important?**
- Provides a **real user experience view**, avoiding misleading averages.
- Enables **proactive alerts** in **Grafana Faro** for performance issues.
- Ensures **optimization for the majority of users**.

🔹 **Key p75 Metrics:**
- **Page Load Time (p75)** → Measures the full load time for 75% of users.
- **CLS (p75)** → Tracks visual stability.
- **FID (p75)** → Measures response time for interactions.

## 🌎 Popular Browsers – User Distribution Insights
### 🔹 **Definition:**
Identifies the **most commonly used web browsers** by visitors.

🔹 **Examples:** Google Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Opera.

🔹 **Why It’s Important?**
- Helps optimize performance for dominant browsers.
- Identifies **browser-specific compatibility issues**.
- Integrated into observability tools like **Grafana Faro**.

---

## 📈 Visits (Sessions) – Traffic & Engagement
### 🔹 **Definition:**
Represents the **number of times users access your website**.

🔹 **Why It’s Important?**
- Tracks **user engagement and traffic trends**.
- Identifies **peak usage periods**.
- Correlates **traffic spikes with performance fluctuations**.

---

## 🎯 Events – Capturing User Interactions
### 🔹 **Definition:**
An **event** represents any interaction on your website, tracked via **Grafana Faro**.

🔹 **Examples of Events:**
- **Click Events** → User clicks a button/link.
- **Form Submissions** → Login or signup actions.
- **Page Views** → Navigating between pages.
- **Errors & Exceptions** → JavaScript errors.
- **Network Requests** → API calls from the browser.

🔹 **Why It’s Important?**
- Helps track **user behavior & experience**.
- Detects **UI/UX pain points**.
- Can trigger **alerts for high error rates**.

---

## 👥 Top Users – Identifying Key Audiences
### 🔹 **Definition:**
Represents the most active users based on engagement metrics.

🔹 **How to Measure?**
- **Number of Sessions** → Most frequent visitors.
- **Engagement Time** → Users with the longest sessions.
- **Number of Events** → Most interactions (clicks, scrolls, etc.).
- **API Requests** → Highest number of backend requests.

🔹 **Why It’s Important?**
- Identifies **power users** and their behaviors.
- Detects **abnormal activity (bots, security threats)**.
- Correlates **user experience with performance issues**.

---

## 🎯 Conclusion – Why These Metrics Matter
✅ Implementing **observability best practices** enhances **website performance and user experience**.

✅ Monitoring **p75-based metrics** helps detect **real-world performance issues** before they impact users.

✅ Combining **Grafana Faro, frontend monitoring, and proactive alerts** ensures **optimized digital experiences** for users.
