# Grafana Faro POC

## Overview
This Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the integration of **Grafana Faro** for frontend observability. Grafana Faro enables logging, tracing, and metrics collection from frontend applications, helping in performance monitoring and debugging.

## Installation
To set up Grafana Faro in your project, install the following packages:

### 1. Faro React SDK
```sh
npm i @grafana/faro-react
```
**Purpose:**
- Provides React-specific bindings for Grafana Faro.
- Simplifies integrating Faro into React applications.
- Automatically collects and reports frontend logs, errors, and telemetry data.

### 2. Faro Web SDK
```sh
npm i @grafana/faro-web-sdk
```
**Purpose:**
- Core SDK for Grafana Faro, designed for frontend observability.
- Enables logging, tracing, and metrics collection from web applications.
- Can be used in any JavaScript/TypeScript application (not limited to React).

### 3. Faro Web Tracing
```sh
npm i @grafana/faro-web-tracing
```
**Purpose:**
- Provides OpenTelemetry tracing support for Grafana Faro.
- Captures distributed traces and propagates context to backend observability systems like **Tempo**.

## Usage
1. **Initialize Faro**: Create a separate file (e.g., `faro.js`) to initialize Faro with logging, tracing, and metrics.
2. **Import and use in your application**: Ensure that Faro is initialized at the application's entry point.
3. **Send telemetry data**: Log messages, capture errors, and send traces to your backend observability stack (Grafana Tempo, Loki, and VictoriaMetrics).

## Next Steps
- Configure Faro to send data to your observability stack.
- Visualize logs, metrics, and traces in **Grafana**.
- Monitor Web Vitals and user interactions to optimize performance.
